"Golden leaves falling from the sky,
Autumn's beauty, a sight to pry.
Cool breeze whispering secrets to trees,
The season of harvest, the season of ease.

Orchards ripe with fruits aplenty,
Fields of wheat, golden and plenty.
The sun sets early, the nights grow long,
Autumn's arrival sings a tranquil song.

A quilt of leaves on the ground so bare,
Colors of sunset, beyond compare.
The scent of pumpkin, apple, and spice,
Autumn's palette, nothing but nice.

Autumn, a painter with a magical touch,
Her canvas the world, we love so much.
As she paints the leaves with hues so bright,
We're captivated by the beautiful sight.

Autumn, a season of warmth and rest,
Of all the seasons, we love you best."
