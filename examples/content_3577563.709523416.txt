Autumn, the season of mellow fruitfulness,
With a cloak of gold and russet undress.
Leaves falling softly from the trees,
Carried on the whisper of the autumn breeze.

Harvest moon shines so bright,
Illuminating the world with its gentle light.
Pumpkins ripe and apples sweet,
Autumn's bounty in every street.

The air is crisp, the days grow short,
Nature's spectacle, a yearly report.
Autumn, in your beauty so grand,
You paint a masterpiece across the land.
