Autumn, oh autumn, your colors so bright,
Underneath the soft, fading light.
Trees dressed in hues of gold and red,
As they prepare for winter's bed.

Leaves falling gently to the ground,
Creating a carpet without a sound.
The air is crisp, the days grow short,
Autumn's beauty of every sort.

Harvest moon in the clear night sky,
As the geese in formation fly.
Pumpkins, apples, and hayrides too,
Autumn, we welcome you.

Autumn, oh autumn, your time is brief,
But you leave us in awe and disbelief.
For your beauty is second to none,
Underneath the autumn sun.
