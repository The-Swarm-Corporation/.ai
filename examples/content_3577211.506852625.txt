Autumn's arrival is a hush,
A painter in a fervent rush,
With golden hues and fiery red,
A canvas overhead is spread.

Leaves that crumble under boot,
In twilight's glow, the owls hoot,
Harvest moon in the starry night,
Autumn's beauty is sheer delight.

Crisp air carries the scent of pine,
Pumpkins lined in a neat line,
Copper leaves and apples fall,
Autumn, the fairest season of all.

In the silence of the dawn,
On the dew-kissed lawn,
The world wakes to a sight so fine,
Autumn's magic, a design divine.

A time of change, a shift, a turn,
As the summer sun adjourns,
Autumn's charm is softly spun,
In the waning light of the setting sun.
